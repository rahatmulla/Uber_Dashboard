# Uber Performance Dashboard - Power BI Visualisation
 
**Project Overview:**  
  
**Business Problem**    
Uber’s operations involve multiple vehicle types and a massive volume of rides each month. However, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as bookings, revenue, and distance across vehicle types and time periods can be complex. The goal was to analyze performance trends, identify top-performing segments, and uncover optimization opportunities.  

**Objective:**  
To design a data-driven **interactive** dashboard that simplifies Uber’s operational analytics by enabling interactive insights into bookings, revenue, and vehicle performance.

## Steps and Workflow
1) Data Cleaning 
2) Data Exploration
3) Data Visualization


**Key Features and Analysis**   
1) KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):  

-Completed Bookings  
-Lost Bookings  
--Revenue  
-Total Distance  
-Average Distance

These key metrics give a quick overview of Uber’s overall performance each month.  

2) Filters & Interactivity:  

Added a Vehicle Type filter so users can easily compare results for Auto, Bike, Go Mini, Go Sedan, etc.

3) Monthly & Quarterly Analysis:  
  
Tracked Completed Bookings to spot seasonal changes and performance trends.  
Analyzed Revenue patterns to see which months performed best (like January and March) and which months could be improved.  
  
  

4) Revenue by Vehicle Type:   
  
Found that Auto had the highest revenue, followed by Go Mini and Go Sedan, showing that customers prefer affordable rides.  
Identified eBike and Uber XL as lower-performing categories, suggesting areas for potential improvement.
